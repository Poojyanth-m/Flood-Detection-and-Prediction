## How it Works ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Data Collection**: Satellite data and environmental parameters are collected from relevant sources.
2. **Flood Detection**: Machine learning algorithms analyze the data to detect flood-prone regions.
3. **Flood Prediction**: A prediction model estimates the likelihood and intensity of potential flood events.
4. **Visualization**: Interactive maps and graphs visualize the flood detection and prediction results.
5. **Real-time Updates**: The system offers real-time alerts based on predictions and detected anomalies.

## Models Used üß†

- **YOLOv5**: Used for detecting flood-affected areas and identifying objects within satellite images. YOLOv5 helps in real-time detection and localization of flood events.
  
- **Mask RNN**: A model employed for segmentation tasks, focusing on detecting and delineating flooded regions in images. It enhances the precision of identifying flooded areas in complex environments.

- **UNet**: A deep learning model for semantic segmentation. UNet is used to classify flood regions from satellite imagery, providing pixel-wise flood detection and creating detailed flood maps.
